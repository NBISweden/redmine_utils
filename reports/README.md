# redmine_utils/reports

This repository contains a collection of (mainly quarto-) scripts for extracting information from Redmine 
and create various reports.

### How to use this (an alternative that requires you to install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/installation/))

A `pixi` workspace file (*pixi.toml*) is included in the parent directory that (hopefully) provides the various packages dependencies required 
for the included scripts. 

To run scripts in command-line, first do:

        pixi shell

To start rstudio from within the pixi workspace, do:

        pixi run rstudio

NB! If this does not work directly, you might need to open the file *pixi.toml* in your text editor and change the 
line `rstudio = "/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/RStudio"` to point to the location of your Rstudio installation.
